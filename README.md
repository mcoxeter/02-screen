# stock-screen

**Usage**
`npm start -- FB`

This program will score a stock on kpis for my value-investing principles. The results are outputted into the following folder:
`C:\Users\Mike\OneDrive - Digital Sparcs\Investing\Value Investing Process\Business analysis/{stock}/basics`

The output file is named {execution date}.json

The program relies on core-data being created for the stock before hand. See [core-data](https://github.com/mcoxeter/core-data)
